<h3>Background</h3>

I am on my way to become a Full Stack Developer. I follow the fantastic [_**Roadmap**_](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) by roadmap.sh. After grasping the JS basics, they suggest adding such training projects to one's porffolio.


While writing this README, I have just completed my first JavaScript tutorial [_**Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerousâ„¢**_](https://www.learnenough.com/courses), and thus this excercise.
