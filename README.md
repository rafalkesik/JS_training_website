<h1>What is this site?</h1>
<p>This site is a demonstration of basic JS skills. It covers a to-do list, GitHub profiles scraper, and a calculator.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I am on my way to become a Full Stack Developer. I follow the fantastic Roadmap (https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) by roadmap.sh. After grasping the JS basics, they suggest adding such training projects to one's porffolio.</p>
<p> While writing this README, I have just completed my first JavaScript tutorial (Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerousâ„¢ (https://www.learnenough.com/courses)), and thus this excercise.</p>
