                The goal of this page is to train and demonstrate my HTML, CSS & JS skills learned from an extensive set of courses by Michael Hartl:
            </p>
    
            <ul class="grid_2-8 info-box-ul" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><a href="/">Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">Learn Enough Style & CSS to Be Dangerous</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">Learn Enough JS to Be Dangerous</a></li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="grid_2-6 info-box">
                The first app created is a To-do App. It is the first vanilla JavaScript web app created on my own. My <a href="https://rafalkesik.github.io">previous app</a> was done as part of the <a href="">Learn Enough JS to Be Dangerous</a> course.
            </p>
    
            <p class="grid_4-8 info-box">
                Note that with each project I learn expenentially more. After finishing the first App, I already know I would have made different choices if I started it again.
